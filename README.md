## 📁 File Uploads (Resume)

Uploaded resumes are stored in the `media/resumes/` folder. Be sure to create that folder and configure Django settings:

```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

In `urls.py`:
```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```
